Converted to GitHub via [cbt2git](https://github.com/wizardofzos/cbt2git)

This is still a work in progress.

//***FILE 986 is from Willy Jensen, and contains programs to make   *   FILE 986
//*           the TSO PUTLINE interface easier to program.  If you  *   FILE 986
//*           are using the TSO PUTLINE interface for output from   *   FILE 986
//*           TSO commands (instead of the TPUT interface), then    *   FILE 986
//*           you can capture the output (and optionally display    *   FILE 986
//*           it fullscreen.                                        *   FILE 986
